# Fly Recognition

This repository contains the software developed at FlySleepLab (Liu Lab) @VIB-KU Leuven CBD to power behavioral tracking in _Drosophila_ _melanogaster_.
It consists of a collection of open source software either published by other groups (like [DeepLabCut](https://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut)  or by ourselves.


## Current lines of action / TO-DOs
- [ ] Try training with less labeled points i.e. one point or feature to be tracked.

- [ ] Label easier objects i.e. the corners of the arena, which don't change

- [ ] Crop videos to focus just on the relevant ROI

- [ ] Add more videos

- [ ] Start something out of DLC (by ourselves)
